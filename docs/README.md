# Documentation

Canonical, self-sufficient documentation for Wasted (Modded) and its Remote Management backend.
Everything needed to set up, operate, upgrade, verify, and reason about the system is here.

## Start here

1. **[Quick start (6 steps)](./backend/quickstart.md)** — the shortest path to a working setup.
2. [Architecture](./architecture.md) — system design, components, safety invariants.
3. [Backend overview](./backend/README.md) — identities, backend component map, documentation map.
4. Then the task-specific guide below.

## Other references

- [`supabase/README.md`](../supabase/README.md) — backend operations quick reference.
- [`supabase/releases/`](../supabase/releases/) — generated SQL per app release (setup, updates,
  verify, manifests, release notes).
- [`web/config.example.js`](../web/config.example.js) — optional build-time configuration.
- [`README.md`](../README.md) — user-facing app/remote/hosting guide.

## Rules

- Applied migrations are immutable. Never edit or rename them.
- Every release that changes SQL must update `supabase/releases.json`.
- Generated SQL (`supabase/setup.sql`, `supabase/releases/**`, APK assets) is build output — never
  edit by hand; run `node supabase/build-setup-sql.mjs` or a Gradle build.
- Never put secrets, project refs, credentials, or real device/account data in docs.
