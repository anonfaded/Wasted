# Backend overview

Remote Management is optional. The app stays fully functional offline; the backend only
synchronizes settings, timers, status, and commands.

## Deployment model

- **Per-user self-hosting:** every user creates their own Supabase project and hosts their own
  dashboard copy. There is no shared backend or central dashboard URL.
- Supabase Cloud is the managed backend. Docker is only for local development/replay.
- The public APK ships unconfigured and makes no network calls until the user configures, enables,
  and enrolls.

## Components

```
Android app ── HTTPS/WSS ──► Supabase (Auth / PostgREST / Realtime)
     │                              ▲
     │ bundled dashboard template   │ owner signs in from browser
     └─ setup wizard ── SAF export ─┘
            │
            └─ user hosts one HTML file (Netlify Drop etc.)
```

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `app/src/main/java/me/lucky/wasted/remote/` | Config, session, sync, command processing, realtime, recovery, UI |
| `app/src/main/java/me/lucky/wasted/admin/ResetExecutor.kt` | Only destructive boundary; Debug Mode re-check |
| `web/` | Dashboard sources; build emits one self-contained HTML file |
| `supabase/migrations/` | Immutable ordered schema history |
| `supabase/releases/` | Generated per-release SQL (setup, updates, verify, manifest) |
| `supabase/tests/` | SQL suites for schema/RLS/RPC/concurrency |

## Identities

- **Owner:** normal email/password Supabase Auth user. Explicit Create Account.
- **Device:** separate anonymous Supabase Auth user per installation, bound to the owner only by a
  one-time enrollment token and the `claim_device_enrollment` RPC.

## Data flow

- Devices reconcile over Realtime (online) or a 60-second heartbeat; commands are durable rows and
  apply at the next sync.
- Realtime events are only invalidations; app and dashboard always refetch durable state.
- Settings are revision-protected; devices apply only newer revisions.
- Command expiry: `reset_timer` 24 h; `force_reset` 10 min; `debug_mode_on` 24 h;
  `debug_mode_off` 10 min.

## Safety and security

- RLS is enabled and forced; direct writes are denied; SECURITY DEFINER RPCs are the only write
  path and enforce ownership.
- Debug Mode defaults ON and is re-read inside `ResetExecutor`; remote Force Reset cannot execute
  while it is ON.
- Per-device Debug Mode control is owner-only; queuing OFF supersedes pending Force Resets.
- Publishable keys are public; secret/service-role keys never ship.
