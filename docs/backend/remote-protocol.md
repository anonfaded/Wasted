# Remote protocol and command semantics

Self-sufficient contract for app ↔ Supabase ↔ dashboard behavior. Source of truth for wire names,
states, TTLs, and ordering.

## Reconcile request (`device_reconcile`)

The device sends (all `p_` prefixed):

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `p_device_id` | Device row id |
| `p_applied_settings_revision` | Last account settings revision applied |
| `p_actual_lock_timer_minutes` | Current local Lock Timer |
| `p_actual_usb_trigger_enabled` | Current local USB trigger |
| `p_timer_remaining_seconds` / `p_timer_running` | Timer state |
| `p_debug_mode` | Current Debug Mode |
| `p_reset_supported` | Device Admin/reset support |
| `p_remote_enabled` | Remote Management enabled locally |
| `p_app_version` / `p_android_sdk` | Build info |
| `p_last_error_code` / `p_last_error_message` | Sanitized last error (optional) |

Response:

```json
{
  "server_time": "…",
  "device": { "id": "…", "account_id": "…", "name": "…", "installation_id": "…", "enrolled_at": "…" },
  "settings": { "revision": 2, "lock_timer_minutes": 1440, "usb_trigger_enabled": true, "initialized": true },
  "commands": [
    { "id": "…", "action_id": "…", "command_type": "reset_timer", "state": "queued", "created_at": "…", "expires_at": "…" }
  ]
}
```

Reconcile also upserts `device_status`, lazily expires overdue commands, and returns only
`queued`/`received` commands that have not expired, ordered by `created_at`.

## Command types and TTLs

| Type | Target | TTL | Terminal outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reset_timer` | All active devices | 24 h | `applied`, `rejected`, `failed`, `expired` |
| `force_reset` | All active devices | 10 min | `reset_initiated`, `debug_blocked`, `rejected`, `failed`, `expired` |
| `debug_mode_on` | One device | 24 h | `applied`, `rejected`, `failed`, `expired` |
| `debug_mode_off` | One device | 10 min | `applied`, `rejected`, `failed`, `expired` |

States: `queued → received → executing → applied` plus terminal `debug_blocked`, `rejected`,
`failed`, `expired`, and the Force Reset terminal `reset_initiated`.

Legal transitions:

| From | To |
| --- | --- |
| `queued` | `received`, `expired` |
| `received` | `executing`, `debug_blocked`, `rejected`, `failed`, `expired` |
| `executing` | `applied`, `reset_initiated`, `debug_blocked`, `failed` |

Per-type terminal allowlist is enforced server-side. Each transition appends exactly one
`command_events` row (one event per state per command).

## Execution ordering

### Reset Timer

1. `queued → received` (server compare-and-set).
2. `received → executing`.
3. Restart the lock timer if active (idempotent).
4. `executing → applied` with `restarted` or `inactive`.
5. Interrupted `executing` rows are re-run safely and completed as `applied`.

### Force Reset

1. `queued → received`.
2. Re-read Debug Mode; if ON → `received → debug_blocked` (`debug_mode`), notify, stop.
3. If reset is unsupported → `received → rejected` (`reset_unsupported`), stop.
4. Persist local `executing`, then require server `received → executing`.
5. Re-read Debug Mode at the boundary; if ON → `executing → debug_blocked`.
6. `executing → reset_initiated` (server) before touching the destructive boundary.
7. Call `ResetExecutor` exactly once (it re-reads Debug Mode again).
8. Interrupted `executing` rows fail with `interrupted_before_reset`; never replay destructively.

### Debug Mode ON/OFF

1. `queued → received → executing`.
2. Read the current preference; if already equal → `applied` with `already_enabled`/`already_disabled`.
3. Otherwise write the preference once → `applied` with `enabled`/`disabled`.
4. A preference write failure → `executing → failed` (`debug_mode_write_failed`).
5. Interrupted `executing` rows re-apply idempotently and complete.
6. This command is never blocked by the current Debug Mode (it is the toggle itself).

## Idempotency and supersede

- Account actions are idempotent per `(account_id, idempotency_key)`; a replay returns the original
  action and does not create commands.
- `set_device_debug_mode` additionally requires the same device/type on replay; reusing a key for a
  different action is rejected.
- Queuing `debug_mode_off` first expires that device's pending `force_reset` commands with
  `superseded_by_debug_off`, so a latent wipe cannot fire after the guard is removed.
- Command/action consistency is enforced by trigger: type, account, expiry, and (when present)
  device must match.

## Settings synchronization

- `account_settings.revision` increments on every save.
- Devices send `applied_settings_revision`; `RemoteSyncCoordinator` applies only newer revisions
  through `LocalSettingsApplier`, then records the revision locally.
- Lock Timer and USB Trigger are the only synced settings; all other preferences stay device-local.

## Errors and retries

- Retryable: network, timeout, HTTP 429, 5xx. Bounded exponential backoff (1 s → 60 s, honoring
  `retry-after`, injectable jitter).
- Fatal: authentication, RLS/permission, validation, expiry, illegal transition. Surface a
  sanitized error; do not loop.
- Local journal stores commands by id (insert-ignore); transitions retry through an encrypted
  outbox. The processor never duplicates application on retries (server CAS + local state).
- WorkManager recovery: unique one-time retry after retryable failures + unique 15-minute periodic
  reconciliation (5-minute flex). A safety net, not immediate delivery.

## Delivery behavior

- Online: Realtime event invalidates and triggers a reconcile.
- Offline: next 60 s heartbeat or recovery run; commands/settings apply subject to expiry.
- Freshness in the dashboard: “recently connected” = last contact ≤ 150 s; otherwise exact last
  contact is shown and commands remain queued.
- Timer display extrapolates locally from `timer_sampled_at` + `timer_remaining_seconds` while
  running.

## Debug Mode semantics

- Default ON; stored encrypted; missing/corrupt/read error = ON.
- ON: destructive remote commands are logged (`debug_blocked`) and notified, not executed; Reset
  Timer and settings sync still work.
- OFF: only via local confirmation (app) or owner command (dashboard, confirmation). Remote OFF
  supersedes pending Force Resets.
- Notifications: settings applied, Reset Timer, Force Reset initiated/blocked/rejected, Debug Mode
  changed, command failures, manual-sync success, sync failure. Heartbeat successes are silent;
  notification IDs are stable so repeats replace.

## RPC authorization

- Owner RPCs require a non-anonymous auth user with an `accounts` row.
- Device RPCs require the device's `auth_user_id` to match the JWT and `revoked_at is null`.
- Enrollment requires an anonymous auth user and a valid, unexpired, unused token.
- RLS additionally limits reads; direct table writes are denied for both roles.
