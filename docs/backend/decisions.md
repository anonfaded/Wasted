# Design decisions (ADR log)

Short architecture decision records so context is not lost if development artifacts are removed.

## ADR-01 — Per-user self-hosting

**Context:** Client requires a portable, self-hosted website; the APK is free for everyone.
**Decision:** Every user creates their own Supabase project and hosts their own dashboard. No
shared backend or central dashboard.
**Consequences:** No operator cost/control for the maintainer; users own data and updates.
Onboarding/upgrades must be documented and guided by the app. A client-operated shared backend
remains a future option if per-user maintenance is unacceptable.

## ADR-02 — App-generated dashboard, no runtime connect screen

**Context:** Users should not edit HTML or use a terminal.
**Decision:** The app bundles a single-file dashboard template; the setup wizard injects the
project URL + publishable key and exports the configured file via Android SAF. Users host it
themselves.
**Consequences:** No file editing, no shared URL, works offline. The file contains the public
publishable key (not a secret). Changing keys requires regenerating/re-uploading. A runtime
connection form was considered and rejected by the client.

## ADR-03 — Fresh setup via one SQL file + Auth toggles

**Context:** End users should not need CLI/Docker.
**Decision:** `setup.sql` (generated from migrations) is pasted once into Supabase SQL Editor.
Two Auth dashboard toggles are required: enable anonymous sign-ins, leave Confirm email enabled.
Anonymous sign-ins give each device a private identity so the owner password never has to be stored
on devices. Confirm email verifies the owner's address; it does not restrict who can sign up. Set the
Auth Site URL to the hosted dashboard URL so confirmation links return there. Both toggles can be
left off if Remote Management is not wanted; the rest of the app and dashboard still work, but device
enrollment and sync will not.
**Consequences:** No tooling; Auth settings cannot be set via SQL and remain a manual step.
Docker/CLI stays a developer path only.

## ADR-04 — Flat immutable migrations + per-release bundles

**Context:** Migrations can pile up; Supabase CLI requires flat timestamped files.
**Decision:** Keep `supabase/migrations/` flat and immutable (developer history). Map releases in
`supabase/releases.json` and generate per-release folders: `setup.sql`, stepwise update bundles,
`verify.sql`, checksums, and generated instructions.
**Consequences:** Users never see granular migrations; upgrades are one file per release, stepwise.
Generated artifacts must be regenerated on every release; applied files never change.

## ADR-05 — No automatic update check

**Context:** Client prefers release-notes-driven updates over in-app polling.
**Decision:** The app does not check schema/app versions. Release notes name the exact SQL bundle;
the APK bundles it.
**Consequences:** Simple, no extra endpoint/permission; users must follow notes. Skipping versions
requires applying each bundle in order.

## ADR-06 — No Docker for end users

**Context:** Docker was considered to “automate” updates.
**Decision:** Docker is only for local development/replay. Hosted Supabase updates use SQL or CLI.
**Consequences:** Avoids server administration (TLS, backups, monitoring) for users. Docker Compose
for self-hosted Supabase remains an advanced operator path, not a product install.

## ADR-07 — Publishable key is public; secret key never ships

**Context:** The dashboard/app must talk to Supabase directly.
**Decision:** Embed/accept only the project URL + publishable key; validate and reject
`sb_secret_*`/`service_role`.
**Consequences:** No secret leakage from the dashboard or APK. Security relies on RLS/RPCs and Auth;
the dashboard URL is public and can receive signup attempts (rate-limited).

## ADR-08 — Explicit Create Account (deviation from spec wording)

**Context:** The client spec suggested auto-creating an account on sign-in “if technically
feasible”.
**Decision:** Keep explicit Sign In and Create Account; a failed sign-in never creates an account.
**Consequences:** Prevents accidental accounts from typos; requires one extra action. Flagged for
client confirmation.

## ADR-09 — Debug Mode is fail-closed and locally stored

**Context:** Remote wipe is dangerous; Debug Mode protects testing.
**Decision:** Debug Mode is stored encrypted on-device, defaults ON, and is re-read inside
`ResetExecutor`. The dashboard can toggle it per device (with confirmations); the device applies
without a local dialog.
**Consequences:** Remote Force Reset is impossible while ON; toggling OFF supersedes pending Force
Resets. No remote path can bypass the reset boundary.

## ADR-10 — Notifications are meaningful-event only

**Context:** Spec lists sync success as a notification; heartbeats occur every 60 s.
**Decision:** Notify on settings applied, Reset Timer, Force Reset outcomes, Debug Mode changes,
command failures, manual-sync success, and sync failure. Heartbeat successes are silent.
**Consequences:** No notification spam; “sync success” is covered by user-requested syncs.

## ADR-11 — UI stack and compatibility

**Context:** Existing app uses XML/ViewBinding; minSdk 24.
**Decision:** Stay on Views/ViewBinding (no Compose rewrite); keep minSdk 24; no AVD downloads for
legacy APIs unless needed.
**Consequences:** Consistent UI and smaller APK; Compose-specific patterns are not used.

## ADR-12 — Hosting recommendation: Netlify Drop

**Context:** Users must host one HTML file easily.
**Decision:** Recommend Netlify Drop (drag one file, HTTPS, no account needed to start); document
Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Vercel, and generic static hosts.
**Consequences:** Minimal steps; no server/CORS/redirect setup. Users must claim the site to keep it.

## ADR-13 — Update research and support window

**Context:** Self-hosted products need predictable upgrade paths.
**Decision:** Follow the mature-OSS pattern: immutable versioned migrations, baselines for fresh
installs, stepwise upgrades, backup-first, no downgrades, and a previous-release support window.
**Consequences:** Users crossing multiple versions apply each release bundle in order; old release
folders stay available. Squashing applied migrations is discouraged.

## ADR-14 — Revocation terminalizes executing commands

**Context:** A device revoked during `executing` could no longer report, leaving an unresolved
destructive command forever.
**Decision:** `revoke_device` atomically rejects `queued`/`received` commands and fails `executing`
ones with `device_revoked_during_execution`; terminal rows are preserved.
**Consequences:** Operators see a definitive terminal state, but the outcome is explicitly unknown
because the device may have crossed the irreversible boundary. Tests cover the state transition.

## ADR-15 — Fail-closed verification and schema marker

**Context:** A weak post-install check can report PASS on a drifted, insecure database.
**Decision:** `verify.sql` checks catalog invariants (FORCE RLS, exact policies/grants, RPC
properties, Realtime scope, cron, schema marker, future-function PUBLIC denial) and raises on any
FAIL. Migrations set a schema-version comment.
**Consequences:** Setup/update operators get a meaningful check without a CLI. The full SQL suites
remain required in the release gate.

## ADR-16 — Anti-framing requires host headers

**Context:** Meta CSP cannot set `frame-ancestors`; a single HTML file cannot prevent framing.
**Decision:** Production hosting must send framing headers; the repo ships `web/_headers` for
header-capable hosts, plus a frame-busting fallback in the page.
**Consequences:** Netlify Drop of a lone file is insufficient for strict framing; deploy a folder
with `_headers` or configure the host. This is documented as a deployment constraint.

## ADR-17 — Notifications follow meaningful events, not heartbeats

**Context:** The spec lists “device successfully synchronized”, but heartbeats run every 60 seconds.
**Decision:** Notify on settings applied, Reset Timer, Force Reset outcomes, Debug Mode changes,
command failures, manual-sync success, and sync failure. Heartbeat successes are silent.
**Consequences:** “Sync success” is covered by user-requested syncs and failure recovery; no
notification spam. This is a deliberate deviation recorded for the client.

## ADR-18 — Devices use anonymous identities plus enrollment tokens

**Context:** The client requires every device to be associated with the account and to have a unique
authentication/authorization credential, without exposing the owner password to devices. The client
also allows automatic account creation only “if technically feasible”; explicit owner accounts are
kept for safety (ADR-08).
**Decision:** The owner signs in with email/password on the dashboard. Each installation signs in
anonymously and is bound to the owner by a single-use, hashed, 10-minute enrollment token. RPCs
distinguish owner and anonymous sessions; RLS scopes all data to the account.
**Consequences:** Anonymous sign-ins must be enabled for Remote Management, but not for the rest of
the app. Disabling them still allows owner sign-in/dashboard use; devices cannot enroll or sync.
Anonymous endpoint abuse is bounded by rate limits and cleanup. Rename/revoke on the dashboard
manage device records without changing this identity model.
