# Wasted Remote — Architecture & Verification Handoff

**Purpose:** give a fresh reviewer (human or agent) everything needed to understand, verify, and
critique this architecture without re-reading the whole conversation. No secrets are included.

**Status:** implementation complete for v3.0.0; validation gates (emulator/device, soak, Docker
replay, fresh-project install, usage reports, wipe E2E) remain open. `plan.md` is the detailed
checklist; this file is the summary and the "why". Canonical documentation lives in
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) and is self-sufficient; this handoff and `plan.md` are temporary
development artifacts that may be deleted without losing operational knowledge.

---

## 1. What this project is

Wasted (Modded) is an Android app (minSdk 24) with Device Admin, local triggers, P2P, and an
optional **Remote Management** layer. The client specification is `archive/wasted update.txt`:
remote settings (Lock Timer, USB Trigger), Reset Timer, Force Reset, device status/registration,
Debug Mode, optional notifications, offline behavior, and a portable self-hosted website.

**Deployment model chosen by the client:**

- The APK is free/public; **every user creates their own Supabase project** and **hosts their own
  dashboard copy**. There is no shared/central dashboard URL.
- The app's setup wizard collects the user's project URL + publishable key, gives them the SQL and
  Auth checklist, then generates a configured single-file dashboard for them to host.
- Backend: Supabase Cloud (managed). No Docker or CLI is required for end users.

## 2. Current state

- App v3.0.0 (versionCode 42); debug APK builds. The signed-release task is fail-closed, but the
  actual release certificate still needs release-gate verification.
- Tests: Android **95/95**, web **25/25**, SQL suites **4/4** (schema, RLS, RPC, concurrency) plus
  the verifier drift negative test, run against the linked project in rolled-back transactions.
- Implemented: Debug Mode boundary, ResetExecutor, reset ordering, per-device Debug Mode commands,
  notifications, Android Remote Management screen, setup wizard, dashboard, enrollment, sync,
  recovery worker, docs.
- Latest dashboard/auth UX: separate Sign In/Create Account forms, live email filtering and
  lowercasing, password visibility toggle, Confirm email + Site URL guidance, editable device names,
  dashboard rename/revoke, confirmation dialogs for settings/tokens/commands, setup-guide links, and
  a `npm run dev` source-testing path.
- Latest audit fixes: exact verifier policy/ACL checks + real-verifier negative harness, single-owner
  account guard, idempotent legacy command repair, deployable ZIP (`index.html` + `_headers`), Sign In
  accepts existing passwords, clipboard warning, cumulative update documentation, and P2P
  certificate pinning/identity binding with an encrypted P2P database.
- Open: emulator matrix, 16 h soak, instrumentation/log-redaction, browser/a11y suites, latency and
  usage evidence, Docker clean replay, fresh-project `setup.sql` verification, wipe E2E (needs
  explicit approval), final acceptance gate.

## 3. Architecture

```
Android app ── HTTPS/WSS ──► Supabase project (Auth / PostgREST / Realtime)
     │                              ▲
     │ bundled dashboard template   │ owner signs in from browser
     └─ setup wizard ── SAF export ─┘
            │
            └─ user hosts one HTML file (Netlify Drop etc.)
```

- **Owner identity:** normal email/password Supabase Auth user (explicit Create Account); the
  account name is a dashboard display identifier, not a login or device name.
- **Device identity:** separate Supabase anonymous Auth user per installation; bound to the owner
  only by a one-time enrollment token and the `claim_device_enrollment` RPC. The app sends an
  editable device name (prefilled with the phone model); the dashboard can rename it.
- **P2P:** peer TLS leaf certificates are pinned during pairing; client certificates are required;
  handshake and message identities are bound to the verified peer; the P2P Room database is
  SQLCipher-encrypted and legacy rows require re-pairing. Pairing PINs use `SecureRandom` with
  one-time consumption and attempt lockout.
- **Writes:** only through SECURITY DEFINER RPCs; direct table writes are denied; RLS is forced.
- **Realtime:** events are only "sync required" signals; both app and dashboard always refetch
  durable state.
- **Agent/device status:** 60 s heartbeat plus Realtime; offline commands wait until the next sync
  and expire (reset_timer 24 h; force_reset/debug_mode_off 10 min; debug_mode_on 24 h).
- **Destructive boundary:** `ResetExecutor` is the only path to `wipeData()`; Debug Mode is re-read
  at entry and immediately before the destructive call. Force Reset runs only when Debug Mode is
  OFF and requires typed confirmation in the dashboard.
- **Per-device Debug Mode control:** `set_device_debug_mode` creates one action/command for one
  device; queuing OFF expires pending Force Resets for that device.
- **No client configuration shipped:** default APK is unconfigured, performs no network work, and
  is fail-closed (`RemoteEngine.create` returns null unless configured + enabled).

## 4. Repository map

- `app/src/main/java/me/lucky/wasted/remote/` — models, repository, sync coordinator, processor,
  engine, realtime, recovery worker, UI (Remote Management + setup wizard).
- `app/src/main/java/me/lucky/wasted/admin/ResetExecutor.kt` — destructive boundary.
- `app/src/main/assets/dashboard-template.html` — generated dashboard template (build product).
- `app/src/main/assets/setup.sql` — generated database setup (build product).
- `web/` — dashboard sources; `dist/index.html` is a build product.
- `supabase/migrations/` — fourteen forward-only migrations (flat, immutable, CLI-compatible
  history).
- `supabase/releases.json` — release manifest (app version → schema version → migrations).
- `supabase/releases/<appVersion>/` — generated SQL per release: `setup.sql`, update bundles,
  `verify.sql`, `manifest.json`, generated `README.md`; `releases/README.md` is the index.
- `supabase/setup.sql` — generated alias of the current release baseline.
- `supabase/verify.sql` — post-install PASS/FAIL checks.
- `supabase/tests/` — four SQL suites plus the verifier drift negative test.
- `supabase/README.md` — install/update/recreate/rollback quick reference.
- `docs/README.md` + `docs/backend/` — canonical setup, migration/release, update, security,
  hosting, troubleshooting, and verification documentation.
- `plan.md` — phase checklists and contract; `HANDOFF.md` — this file.
- `evidence/` — gitignored validation logs.

## 5. Self-host onboarding (what the user does)

1. Create a free Supabase project.
2. In the app: Remote Management → **Open setup wizard**; paste the Project URL + publishable key
   (never the secret/service-role key).
3. In Supabase SQL Editor: paste and run `setup.sql` once.
4. In Authentication → Providers: **enable Anonymous sign-ins** for devices and **leave Confirm
   email enabled** for the owner. Keep the documented rate limits. After hosting, set
   Authentication → URL Configuration → **Site URL** to the dashboard URL so confirmation links
   return there.
5. Run `verify.sql`; every row must say PASS.
6. In the wizard: **Generate dashboard file** → save as `index.html` via SAF, or use **Save
   deployable package (.zip)** for `index.html` + `_headers`.
7. Host the file (Netlify Drop recommended; any HTTPS static host), claim the site, and copy the
   final URL. When updating, replace `index.html` in the **same site**; a new site changes the URL.
8. Open the dashboard → Create Account (confirm the email, then sign in, then choose an account
   name). In the app: paste the dashboard URL, Save, Enable; optionally set a device name; create
   an enrollment token in the dashboard and claim it in the app.
9. Send Reset Timer and confirm the device card updates.

**Why the Auth toggles are needed:** device identities call `signInAnonymously()`; Supabase treats
anonymous sign-ins as an opt-in provider. Confirm email verifies the owner's address; with it on,
Create Account sends a link, the user clicks it and signs in, then finishes the account-name step.
Confirm email does **not** restrict who can create an account; a single-owner signup guard or
host-level access control would be a separate hardening decision.

## 6. Update management (the confusing part — read this)

### 6.1 The problem

There are four independently updated things:

| Component | Who updates | How | Rollback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android APK | user | install the new APK | reinstall the previous APK (schemas stay backward-compatible) |
| Dashboard HTML | user | regenerate in the app, re-upload | keep the previous file |
| Database schema | user (self-host) | apply the release's update SQL, or CLI `db push` | restore a backup / forward-fix |
| Supabase platform | Supabase | managed by Supabase | n/a |

The hard part is the **database schema**, because it is owned by each user and the app cannot run
DDL with a publishable key (and must not ship a secret key).

### 6.2 How mature self-hosted projects do it (research)

- **Immich:** semantic versioning; users read release notes/breaking changes, bump the pinned
  image version, then `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`; migrations run on startup;
  downgrades are not supported; backups are required before risky migrations.
- **Nextcloud:** upgrades are explicit, step-by-step (latest point release → next major), with
  release-note review, a fresh backup, maintenance mode, no skipping majors, no downgrades, and
  background migrations that must finish before the next upgrade.
- **Self-hosted Supabase:** monthly tested Docker snapshots, pinned `self-hosted/v*` tags, an
  `update.sh` that three-way merges configuration, a changelog, and operator responsibility for
  backups/TLS/updates. Docker Compose is a deployment path only for people who run servers.
- **12-factor:** database migrations are one-off admin processes shipped with the same release,
  run once against the same code/config — not part of request handling.
- **Auto-updaters (Watchtower):** convenient but risky for stateful services; mature setups pin
  image tags, enable auto-updates per service, exclude databases, and monitor.
- **General migration practice:** versioned, ordered, reviewed migrations; backward-compatible
  (expand → migrate → contract); backup/rehearse on a restored copy; record what ran.
- **Flyway-style tooling:** versioned migrations are applied exactly once, tracked in a history
  table with checksums; a baseline covers existing databases; repeatable migrations handle
  views/functions. Companies test both fresh installs and upgrades.

### 6.3 What this project does today

- `setup.sql` is generated from the tracked migrations for fresh projects (deterministic,
  offline); it is not edited by hand and Gradle regenerates it before every APK build.
- `supabase/releases.json` maps every app release to its cumulative migration list and schema
  version. `supabase/build-setup-sql.mjs` validates that the manifest covers every migration
  exactly once, then emits per-release folders:
  - `supabase/releases/<appVersion>/setup.sql` (fresh installs for that release),
  - `supabase/releases/<appVersion>/update-from-<old>-to-<new>.sql` (cumulative bundles from each
    earlier release),
  - `supabase/releases/<appVersion>/verify.sql`, `manifest.json` (SHA-256 checksums), and a
    generated `README.md` with apply instructions.
  The current release's setup and update SQL are copied into the APK assets; the root
  `supabase/setup.sql` is a generated alias for the current baseline.
- **No automatic update check** (client decision). Release notes state exactly which file to run.
- The remote database is verified against the migrations (`supabase db diff --linked` plus
  `supabase migration list --linked`); an empty diff means the remote equals the tracked schema.
- Never re-run `setup.sql`; users apply the generated update bundle for each release they cross.

### 6.4 Update policy (implemented)

**For end users (no tools):**

1. Release notes name the exact update bundle (for example
   `update-from-3.0.0-to-3.1.0.sql`) and the backup step.
2. The APK bundles the setup SQL and the update bundles, so the user can copy the file from the
   release/app without hunting through Git.
3. Back up the project first (Database → Backups, or `supabase db dump`); Supabase Free has no PITR.
4. Apply the cumulative bundle matching the installed version once in SQL Editor, then run
   `verify.sql`; no intermediate bundles are required.
5. Downgrades are not supported; restoring a backup is the rollback path. Keeping migrations
   additive means an older APK still works against a newer schema.

**For technical users / the client's own deployment:** Supabase CLI (`supabase link`,
`supabase db push`) with migration history; CI can run `db diff --linked` and the SQL suites.
Docker is only required for local development/replay, not for hosted updates.

**No automatic update check:** the app does not poll for schema/app versions. Release notes are
the contract. If a future check is ever wanted, it can read a version table, but it is out of scope.

**If this still feels too hard for the audience:** the only truly low-maintenance model is a
**client-operated shared backend** (the client creates one Supabase project and one dashboard; end
users never see Supabase or run SQL). That is the industry-standard consumer model and removes
per-user update management, but it changes the current "everyone self-hosts" requirement and the
"no config in the public APK" rule for that deployment.

### 6.4a How the migration history is organized (company practice)

- **One immutable, timestamped file per logical change** (current convention:
  `20261020131724_remote_debug_mode_commands.sql`). Never edit or renumber an applied migration.
- **Migrations are developer history; users only see generated artifacts.** Granular files can
  accumulate without affecting users: `setup.sql` (baseline) and per-release update bundles are
  generated. This is the standard split between source-of-truth history and distributable
  artifacts.
- **A release manifest maps app version → schema version → migration list** (`releases.json`).
  Schema version increments only when SQL changes; an app-only release reuses the schema version
  and ships no update bundle. Generated artifacts carry checksums for verification.
- **Versioned, applied-once migrations with history/checksums** are the industry norm (Flyway
  tracks a history table and checksums; Supabase uses `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`).
  Applied files must never change, or history/checksum validation fails.
- **Fresh installs get a baseline, existing installs get deltas.** Flyway calls this baseline +
  versioned migrations; Nextcloud and Immich keep stepwise upgrade paths rather than one giant
  script. Our `setup.sql` is the generated baseline; `updates/` are the deltas.
- **Backward-compatible changes (expand → migrate → contract)** let old clients keep working
  during upgrades. This project only makes additive changes in the initial release; destructive
  changes would need a multi-release expand/contract plan.
- **Test both paths in CI:** fresh apply (setup), upgrade from the previous release (update
  bundle), then verification and `db diff` parity. Testing only fresh installs misses upgrade bugs.
- **On pile-up / squashing:** do not rewrite applied migrations casually. Supabase's
  `migration squash` produces a schema-only file and explicitly omits data, cron jobs, storage
  buckets, and vault secrets, so it cannot replace our generated setup/update artifacts. If the
  folder becomes unwieldy, archive at a major milestone with a new baseline, repair migration
  history, and keep the old update bundles for supported upgrade paths.
- **Supported upgrade window:** publish an explicit matrix (for example, upgrade from the previous
  release only, stepwise for older versions) and keep old update bundles available. Companies
  usually support N-1 or N-2, never arbitrary jumps.

### 6.5 Developer release runbook

1. Add a new timestamped migration; never edit applied migrations.
2. Add a release entry to `supabase/releases.json` with the new `appVersion`, `schemaVersion` (only
   if SQL changed), and the cumulative migration list.
3. Run the SQL suites and `verifyRemoteSchema` (Docker) against the linked project.
4. Build: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleDebug` — Gradle validates the manifest,
   regenerates `setup.sql`/update bundles, and copies them into assets (Node 20+ required).
5. Publish release notes (breaking changes, exact update bundle, backup warning) and the APK.
6. Verify generated artifacts are current (`git diff --exit-code`) and record the bundle checksums.

### 6.5a User update runbook

1. Read release notes; export a database backup (Supabase Free has no PITR; see `plan.md` §17).
2. Update the app (APK) — old schemas remain compatible.
3. Apply the named update bundle in SQL Editor (copy it from the release or the app assets).
4. Run `verify.sql`; every row must say PASS.
5. Regenerate and replace `index.html` in the **same Netlify site** (do not create a new site);
   update the Dashboard URL in Remote Management only if the URL actually changed.
6. Apply only the cumulative bundle matching the installed version, then run `verify.sql`.

### 6.6 Why not generate `setup.sql` from a live dump?

- `supabase db dump` runs `pg_dump` in a Docker container against a linked project; it excludes
  Supabase-managed schemas and by default omits data and custom roles.
- Publications and cron jobs are not reliably captured; restoring requires manual patches.
- A dump is a snapshot/backup, not a versioned install or update path.
- Therefore migrations remain the source of truth; dumps verify/backup the remote. `setup.sql`
  is generated from migrations, and parity is checked with `db diff --linked`.

### 6.7 Why not Docker for end users?

Supabase documents Docker Compose as a way to run your own Supabase stack, with the operator
responsible for server provisioning, TLS, backups, monitoring, and updates. That is a server-admin
project, not a normal-user install. The Supabase CLI's local stack is explicitly **not** hardened
for production. Docker would add work, not remove it, for hosted Supabase users.

## 7. Security model (verify these)

- Publishable key is public by design; secret/service-role keys are rejected by validation and
  never embedded. The dashboard contains only URL + publishable key.
- RLS is enabled and forced on all remote tables; direct writes are denied; RPCs are the only
  write surface and enforce ownership/active-device checks.
- Enrollment tokens are single-use, hashed at rest, 10-minute expiry, and revocable.
- Debug Mode defaults ON; `ResetExecutor` re-reads it at the boundary; remote Force Reset is
  impossible while ON.
- No secrets in Git: `.env`, keystore, service keys, dumps, tokens. APK scan shows no key material
  or project URL/ref.
- The generated dashboard URL is public; anyone with it can attempt signups. A single-owner guard
  prevents a second dashboard account; additional Auth users remain inert. Confirm email verifies
  ownership but does not restrict signups. RLS prevents cross-account access; rate limits and the
  anonymous-identity cleanup limit abuse. Host-level access control remains optional hardening.

## 8. Verification checklist for the reviewing agent

1. Read `archive/wasted update.txt` and compare scope against §1–3; flag missing requirements.
2. Inspect RLS/RPCs in `supabase/migrations/` and run the four suites; check cross-account/device
   isolation and denied direct writes.
3. Inspect `ResetExecutor` and `RemoteCommandProcessor`; confirm no other `wipeData()` path and the
   Debug Mode double-check ordering.
4. Build and test:
   - `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleDebug` (Node 20+; assets regenerate).
   - `cd web && npm test && npm run build && npm run build:android-template`.
   - `node supabase/build-setup-sql.mjs` then `git diff --exit-code` (generated files current).
5. Backend: `./gradlew :app:verifyRemoteSchema` (Docker + linked project) must report no changes;
   `supabase migration list --linked` must have no local-only/remote-only versions.
6. Fresh-project gate (open): create an empty project, run `setup.sql`, `verify.sql`, the four
   suites, then connect the generated dashboard and enroll a test device.
7. Security scans: tracked-secret grep; APK key/URL scan; `.env`/keystore git-ignored; check CSP.
8. Review the update policy in §6 against the target audience; confirm whether per-user
   self-hosting is still the right product model or a client-hosted backend is needed.

## 9. Known gaps

- **R2-M1 verifier:** exact policy/table/role/mode/predicate matching, extra-policy rejection,
  default-ACL presence, and an effective create-function probe are implemented; verify against a
  fresh database and run the negative drift test (`supabase/tests/remote_verify_drift_test.sql`)
  plus the real-verifier harness (`supabase/tests/verify_negative.sh`).
- **R2-M2 public signup:** a single-owner guard now rejects a second dashboard account, and the
  dashboard maps the error to a sign-in prompt. Public Auth signups may still create inert users;
  rate limits remain, and disabling email signups/host access control is still a deployment choice.
  Verify the live Auth setting.
- **Anti-framing deployment:** the app now exports a deployable ZIP with `index.html` + `_headers`.
  Actual deployed response headers and a benign frame test remain to be verified.
- **R2-L1 sign-in password:** Sign In accepts existing passwords; Create Account keeps the
  12-character rule. Verify no client-side sign-in minimum remains.
- **R2-L2 legacy revocation rows:** the linked project currently has zero `executing` commands;
  the idempotent `private.repair_legacy_revoked_commands()` repair is applied and covered by the RPC
  suite. Re-check on any earlier-schema deployment.
- **R2-L3 docs:** token independence, test counts, notification default, migration count, manifest
  contents, and cumulative update wording are corrected; audit for regressions.
- **R2-L4 clipboard:** dashboard warns that copied tokens remain in OS clipboard/history.
- **P2P hostile-input/runtime tests:** certificate spoof, mismatched handshake/message ID, unpaired
  certificate, replay, legitimate re-pair, encrypted P2P DB, and legacy import still need emulator/
  two-device evidence.
- Upgrade-path CI not wired: apply each generated cumulative bundle to a database at the previous
  release, then run `verify.sql` and the SQL suites.
- Update bundles are in the APK assets but the setup wizard does not list/browse them yet; release
  notes are the current source of which file to run.
- Fresh-project `setup.sql` execution not yet proven end-to-end.
- Emulator/device matrix, soak, latency/battery, browser/a11y, instrumentation/log redaction,
  Docker clean replay + diff, Usage/Realtime reports, wipe E2E approval.
- Custom/self-hosted Supabase domains need a custom CSP/build (the shipped CSP allows
  `*.supabase.co`).
- Auto-create-on-sign-in from the client spec is intentionally replaced by explicit Create Account
  (safer). Confirm this deviation with the client.

## 10. Open decisions / questions

1. Keep per-user self-hosting, or offer a client-operated shared backend for non-technical users?
2. Keep explicit Create Account, or follow the spec's auto-create wording?
3. Add a single-owner signup guard / disable public email signups after owner creation?
4. Is CAPTCHA for anonymous sign-ins required by the client? (Supabase recommends it; not requested.)

## 12. Glossary (plain language)

- **Supabase project:** the user's hosted backend (database, auth, realtime). Identified by a URL.
- **Publishable key:** public identifier for that project; safe in web/mobile code. Not a password.
- **Secret/service-role key:** full database access; never in the app or dashboard.
- **RLS:** database rules that limit each signed-in user to their own rows.
- **RPC:** an audited database function; the only write path.
- **Migration:** a versioned SQL change; `setup.sql` is all migrations concatenated for a fresh DB.
- **Dump:** a schema/data snapshot for backup/verification, not an install script.
- **SAF:** Android's file picker; the app uses it to save the generated dashboard.
- **Netlify Drop:** drag-and-drop static hosting; no account needed to start.
- **Anonymous identity:** per-device Supabase account without email/password, bound by enrollment.
